To find the probability expected value (also known as the expected value) through a histogram, you can follow these steps:

Step 1: Understand the Histogram
- A histogram represents the distribution of a dataset by showing the frequency of data points within specified bins or intervals.
- Each bin has a corresponding midpoint (or value) and frequency (or probability).

Step 2: Calculate the Probability of Each Bin
- Calculate the probability of each bin by dividing the frequency of the bin by the total number of data points. This gives you the probability that a data point falls within that bin.

P(x_i) = Frequency of Bin i / Total Number of Data Points

Step 3: Determine the Midpoint (or Value) of Each Bin
- Identify the midpoint or representative value for each bin. This is usually the average of the bin's upper and lower boundaries.

Step 4: Compute the Expected Value
- The expected value is the sum of the products of each bin's probability and its corresponding midpoint.

E(X) = Σ P(x_i) * x_i

Where:
- E(X) is the expected value.
- P(x_i) is the probability of the i-th bin.
- x_i is the midpoint or value of the i-th bin.

Example Calculation
Suppose you have a histogram with three bins:

| Bin | Midpoint x_i | Frequency | Probability P(x_i) |
|-----|--------------|-----------|---------------------|
| 1   | 2            | 5         | 0.25                |
| 2   | 4            | 10        | 0.50                |
| 3   | 6            | 5         | 0.25                |

Total number of data points: 20

1. Calculate the probability for each bin:
   - For Bin 1: P(x_1) = 5/20 = 0.25
   - For Bin 2: P(x_2) = 10/20 = 0.50
   - For Bin 3: P(x_3) = 5/20 = 0.25

2. Calculate the expected value:
   E(X) = (0.25 * 2) + (0.50 * 4) + (0.25 * 6) = 0.5 + 2 + 1.5 = 4

So, the expected value E(X) is 4.

This is how you compute the probability expected value using a histogram.


To find the midpoint of a bin or interval in a histogram, you can use the following formula:

Midpoint
=
Lower Boundary
+
Upper Boundary
2
Midpoint= 
2
Lower Boundary+Upper Boundary
​
 

Steps:
Identify the boundaries of the bin:

The lower boundary is the smallest value in the bin.
The upper boundary is the largest value in the bin.
